 * What statement best describes encapsulation?
 * a)
 * Encapsulation ensures that classes can be designed so that only certain fields and methods of an object are accessible from other objects.
 * 
 * b)
 * Encapsulation ensures that classes can be designed so that their methods are inheritable.
 * 
 * c)
 * Encapsulation ensures that classes can be designed with some fields and methods declared as abstract.
 * 
 * d)
 * Encapsulation ensures that classes can be designed so that if a method has an argument MyType x, any subclass of MyType can be passed to that method.
 * 
 * Answer : 
 * a)
 * Encapsulation ensures that classes can be designed so that only certain fields and methods of an object are accessible from other objects.
 * 
 * Explanation: 
 * Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.
